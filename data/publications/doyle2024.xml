	<about>
		<p>
		The manuscript, <i>Codex Paulinus Wirziburgensis</i>,
		contains the Latin text of the epistles of St. Paul.
		Marginal and interlinear glosses explaining this
		text have been added to the codex in three
		distinguishable scribal hands. Dating from
		about the middle of the eighth century, these
		glosses comprise one of the earliest large
		bodies of text written in Irish.
		</p>
		<p>
		The purpose of this site is to make to make the
		Würzburg Irish glosses available in digital format.
		The digital text is based on the edition of
		the glosses available in <i>Thesaurus
		Palaeohibernicus, Vol. 1</i> (Stokes and Strachan,
		1901). Here the editors present 3,501 glosses which
		include Irish content, noting however, that further
		glosses have apparently been lost due to the age
		of the manuscript, and the process of its binding.
